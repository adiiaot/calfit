## 1. Overview & Architecture

CalFit is a full-featured fitness and nutrition app powered by AI. Users can generate personalized workouts and meal plans, track calories and macros, log sleep and body measurements, manage intermittent fasting, chat with an AI coach (with voice input), partner with friends for accountability, scan food with the camera, and monitor progress with detailed analytics and exportable reports.

### State Management (Zustand)

Four Zustand stores manage all app state:

| Store | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `authStore` | User, session, profile, onboarding status, live steps count |
| `themeStore` | Light/dark color scheme |
| `aiCoachStore` | Current AI workout, saved workouts, chat messages, loading state |
| `mealPlanStore` | Current AI meal plan, saved plans, loading state |

### Key Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `supabase.ts` | Supabase client with cross-platform storage (SecureStore native, localStorage web) |
| `nvidia-client.ts` | All NVIDIA AI API calls (workout gen, meal plan, chat, food scan, recipes) |
| `foodSearchService.ts` | Open Food Facts API + Nigerian local food database fallback |
| `profileService.ts` | Profile CRUD, daily calorie/water/step queries |
| `notificationService.tsx` | In-app notification CRUD and trigger functions |
| `reminderService.ts` | Scheduled local notifications (meal, water, workout, sleep, streak reminders) |
| `aiAnalysisService.ts` | Workout trend analysis, predictions, suggestions |
| `imageService.ts` | Camera/gallery image picking, avatar upload to Supabase Storage |
| `VoiceRecorderService.ts` | Audio recording + Deepgram transcription |
| `stepService.ts` | Pedometer subscription, step data persistence |

---

## 2. Navigation Structure

The app uses React Navigation v7 with conditional stacks based on auth state.

### Root Level

```
NavigationContainer
  ├── user && !isOnboarding → AppStack
  └── otherwise → AuthStack
```

### AuthStack (no headers)

| Route | Screen | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Welcome` | WelcomeScreen | Landing page with features, "Get Started" CTA |
| `Onboarding` | OnboardingScreen | 5-step wizard (welcome → goal → stats → account → generating) |
| `Subscription` | SubscriptionScreen | Tier selection (shown during onboarding) |

### AppStack (Stack Navigator)

| Route | Screen | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Main` | TabNavigator | Main tabbed interface |
| `Settings` | SettingsScreen | Full settings page |
| `EditProfile` | EditProfileScreen | Edit profile fields |
| `Subscription` | SubscriptionScreen | Upgrade/manage tier |

### TabNavigator (Custom Bottom Tab Bar)

**4 visible tabs** + floating RadialMenu "+" button at center:

| Tab | Icon | Screen |
|---|---|---|
| Home | home/home-outline | HomeScreen |
| Calorie | nutrition/nutrition-outline | CalorieScreen |
| AI Coach | bulb/bulb-outline | AICoachScreen |
| Notes | book/book-outline | NotesScreen |

**Radial Menu ("+")** opens a circular menu with 5 options:
- Activity → WorkoutScreen
- Health → MealsScreen
- Meal Plans → MealPlanScreen
- Progress → ProgressScreen
- Scan Food → FoodScannerScreen

**Other screens** accessible from within the app (not tab-level): QuickStart, Analysis, Recap, Streaks, Sleep, Notifications, Accountability, PartnerChat, IntermittentFasting, BodyMeasurements, EquipmentPreferences, DownloadData, Privacy, Goals.

The `useSteps` hook is mounted in TabNavigator (not on individual screens) so the pedometer subscription persists across all navigation.

---

## 3. Auth Flow

CalFit uses **anonymous authentication** — no email, no password, no social login required.

1. User taps "Get Started" on WelcomeScreen → navigates to OnboardingScreen
2. Onboarding steps through: (1) Welcome intro, (2) Goal selection, (3) Height/weight entry, (4) Name/username, (5) Generating/setup
3. On final step, calls `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()` to create an anonymous Supabase session
4. Profile is saved to the `profiles` table
5. After a 1.5s setup delay, `isOnboarding` flag is set to `false`, and the navigator switches from AuthStack to AppStack
6. Session is persisted via SecureStore (native) or localStorage (web) for return visits
7. **Sign out** clears all Zustand stores and calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`, returning to WelcomeScreen
8. **Delete account** performs local sign-out only (the server-side edge function wasn't implemented)

---

## 4. Dashboard (HomeScreen)

Central command center showing the user's fitness status at a glance.

**Components displayed:**

- **Greeting header** with user name, notification bell badge (unread count), avatar → settings
- **ComebackBanner** — detects inactivity (2+ days), encourages user to return (24h cooldown)
- **BurnoutBanner** — shows when sleep < 6h avg AND workout activity is high
- **StreakRow** — weekly calendar with ring-shaped day dots, current streak count
- **HeroCarousel** — 3 auto-scrolling slides: Calories (consumed/goal), Macros (protein/carbs/fat), Today's Stats (steps, water, sleep)
- **StatCards** — mini cards for water intake, steps progress, sleep hours
- **QuickLog buttons** — +Food, +Water, +Sleep, Workout (each opens the relevant screen)
- **Accountability Partners** card — summary of partner connections
- **Streaks card** — current streak summary

Pull-to-refresh reloads all data.

- Hardcoded fallbacks if NVIDIA API is unavailable

### Voice Transcription Flow

```
Client (audio recording) → Supabase Edge Function (deepgram-proxy) → Deepgram API → Transcription text → Client → AI Coach Chat
```

### Step Tracking Flow

```
Pedometer sensor → expo-sensors → useSteps hook (TabNavigator level) → Zustand authStore.liveSteps → All screens read from store → Saved to step_logs every 60s
```

### Notification Flow

- In-app: functions create rows in `notifications` table → NotificationsScreen reads and displays
- Push: expo-notifications schedules local notifications
